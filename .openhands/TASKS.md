# Task List

1. ✅ Analyze upstream PR All-Hands-AI/agent-sdk#49 (files, comments) and current config code
Prepared review summary inline below; focused on defaults/side-effects and merge semantics; identified redundancies and brittle checks; confirmed no V0 precedence/overwrite logic needed.
2. ✅ Trim remaining redundant tests per goals
Removed complex MCP merge scenario and optional-None LLM test; added xfail to document desired post-merge duplicate detection; left desired SHTTP & cross-type duplicates as xfail.
3. ✅ Run linters and type checks on changed files
pre-commit on modified files passed.
4. ✅ Run pytest on focused test subsets and overall sanity
Config tests alone: 51 passed, 1 xfailed, 2 xpassed in 1.4s. Full repo run hits environment MemoryError late in tools tests; unrelated to our changes.
5. 🔄 Commit changes and push branch simplify-config-tests
Committed locally. Push blocked by token restrictions in this environment; need maintainer to push.
6. ⏳ Open PR from simplify-config-tests into enyst:port-config-tests with review summary
Blocked on pushing branch; draft PR text prepared below.
